6-9. Favorite Places: Make a dictionary called favorite_places. Think of three names to use as keys in the dictionary,
and store one to three favorite places for each person. To make this exercise a bit more interesting, ask some friends
to name a few of their favorite places. Loop through the dictionary, and print each person’s name and their favorite
places.
